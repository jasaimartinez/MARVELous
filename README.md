This project runs through flask and uses elements of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Python:
Purpose: As a fellow Marvel stan I wanted to create a fun website that marvel users can use to get information about every movie ever released. Users can see critic ratings for each movie and descriptions, they can rate movies themselves, and see how other marvels stans have rated movies!

Register/Login: As a user of our website, you must register to access all the interactive features. Users have to create a unique username and a password that is at least 8 characters, contains an uppercase and lowercase. If any of the criteria is failed or if the login information is wrong, a cute groot will tell you what you did wrong and the steps you must take to login successfully.

After login:

General: The general tab is a table of every single Marvel movie ever released. Here users can see the name, the year it was released, the poster, critic score via rotten tomatoes, and a brief description. The users can't input any new data in this tab but they can scroll through all 30 released movies and learn more about each one. This can also help new users who haven't seen all movies learn more aboout each one and see what might interest them to watch.

Ratings: This is the fun part where all the action happens. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is broken up into four phases that have all been complete. Each phase marks a new beginning for the MCU and users can rank every movie in every phase! Click each dropdown phase to see the list of movies released in that phase. Then Click the specific movie you want to rate.
Once a movie is chosen. The screen will change a bit! The color scheme will match the mark of the phase. The poster for the movie selected will appear. And the user is prompted with more interaction to rate their movie. The user can move the slider to their desired rating on a scale of 1-100 (similar to the critic score). The user can then type the name of the movie they are rating, and a comment to justify their rating. Once all is complete submit the rating!

Discussion: Users are greeted with our original avengers at the top of the screen. This is where users can learn more about other fans from our site! The table displays the most recent ratings to the first ratings of the website. Here we can see the username of the person who submitted the rating, the score and the comment left. This discussion is a super valuable insight to gauge what people think of the movies. Critic scores are one opinion but the heart of marvel lies with the fans. The table then ends with the characters from the MCU TV shows that were released in phase 4. Although the TV shows are not a part of the movie sequence, their special appearance makes their way into our discussion tab.

Logout/Return Home: Users can log out of their account anytime at the top right with logout. If you want to return to the main page without any of our specialized tabs you can click on our marvelous in the top left or the marvel logo.

Happy Ratings Marvel Lovers!
